    <h2>JTS & Spatial</h2>
    This document describes what is necessary to set up a database with spatial features enabled and uses JTS on
    top of that for calculation. Both features incorporated into a play/scala application
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Set up the database</h2>
    Consider the following scenario:
    You want to store districts with a shape (most likely a polygon) natively in your database. You could do the
    following:
    <pre>
        CREATE TABLE shapes (
            id bigint(20) NOT NULL,
            district_name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
            shape BLOB NOT NULL,
            PRIMARY KEY (id)
        );
    </pre>
    with <code>shape</code> being your column for that ploygon data. This would leave the marshalling and unmarshalling
    of
    the BLOB to the user of the table. That's very inconvenient.
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Enter Spatial</h2>
    Now there are lots of databases that support geographical data like polygons - the most famous being PostgreQSL. But
    there are others as well like Mysql and Oracle. The spatial feature provides the datatype <code>geometry</code>. So
    your table definition could look like:
    <pre>
        CREATE TABLE shapes (
            id bigint(20) NOT NULL,
            district_name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
            shape geometry NOT NULL,
            PRIMARY KEY (id)
        );
    </pre>
    Now it's easy for the consumer of the table to interpret the <code>shape</code> column.
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Enable Spatial</h2>
    In this project we're using H2 as an in-memory-database. H2 supports spatial. To enable we depend on
    <pre>
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.orbisgis&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;h2gis&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;1.2.2-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
    </pre>
    and put a snippet into our evolution scripts:
    <pre>
        CREATE ALIAS IF NOT EXISTS SPATIAL_INIT FOR
          "org.h2gis.h2spatialext.CreateSpatialExtension.initSpatialExtension";
        CALL SPATIAL_INIT();
    </pre>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Bootstrapping the Database</h2>
    Let's have a look at how we can now load data into our database. We have a file with entries like these:
    <pre>
        1
        Adlershof
        POLYGON ((52.431486129761 13.563772201538, [...], 52.431486129761 13.563772201538))
    </pre>
    The last line is essentially our shape. We can store this including its semantics as well known text. Well
    known text a concept taken from JTS.

    Now let's store the values:
    <pre>
        val stmt = c.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO SHAPES (id, district_name, shape) VALUES (?, ?, ?);")
        stmt.setInt(1, id.toInt)
        stmt.setString(2, districtName)
        stmt.setWKT(3, wkt)

        stmt.execute()
    </pre>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Querying Spatial Database</h2>
    Query our database using spatial feature is pretty easy.
    <pre>
        val sql = "select district_name from shapes where ST_Contains(shape, ?)"
        val stmt = c.prepareStatement(sql)
        stmt.setWKT(1, wkt)
        val resultSet = stmt.executeQuery()
    </pre>
    You prepare a statement and use a user given geometry in the format of well known text as parameter for querying.
    In this case you check whether the given geometry is contained within any stored district.
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Adding spatial features to sql statements</h2>
    Have a look at the class <code>WKTHelper</code>. You'll find the necessary conversion there.
    <pre>
          implicit class WKTPreparedStatement(val stmt: PreparedStatement) {
            def setWKT(parameterIndex: Int, wkt: String) = stmt.setBytes(parameterIndex, wkt.toWKB)
         }
    </pre>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Testing the application</h2>
    You can start the application and open a browser on port 9000. We have prepared a test page with district data
    of Berlin for you. Have querying!
